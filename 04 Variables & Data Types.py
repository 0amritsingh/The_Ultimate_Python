# Variables and Data types
# variables are containers in which you can store any data type (str, int) to use it.
a = 1  # In this a is variable and 1 is a data type i.e int
print(a)

# Data Types:
# There are different types of data that can we store in a variable.

# A. Numeric Data:
# 1. int (1, -1, 0)
# 2. float (1.2, -1.2, 0.0001)
# 3. complex (we will learn it later)
a1 = 0
b1 = 1
c1 = -2
d1 = 1.2
print(a1, b1, c1, d1)

# B. Text Data:
# sting or str ("the text writen in double or single colons")
a2 = "name"
print(a2)

# C. Boolean Data:
# Boolean data consists of values True or False.
a3 = True
b3 = False
print(a3, "and", b3)

# D. none
# its just none, I don't know a lot about that.
a4 = None
print(a4)

# Testing all 4 Data types by using type perameter:
print("This is Numaric Data: ", type(a1))
print("This is Text Data: ", type(a2))
print("This is Boolean Data: ", type(a3))
print("This is None: ", type(a4))

# There are Sequenced data i.e list, tuple and Mapped data i.e dict. We will learn it later.
