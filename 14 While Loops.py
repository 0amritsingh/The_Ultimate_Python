# While Loops in Python:

# Positive Looping:
i = 0
while (i <= 5):
    print(i)
    i = i + 1 # or i += 1

print("\n")
# Negitive Looping:
j = 5
while (j >= 0):
    print(j)
    j = j - 1 # or i -= 1

print("\n")
# Using Else in While Loop:
k = 0
while (k < 5):
    print(k)
    k = k + 1
else:
    print(5) # this will run only with the condition is FALSE.  
    
# So, in other languages one more type of loop that exists `do-while loops`.

# Do-while loop is just like while loop but a slight difference i.e. it runs the code at least once before riding into the loop condition.

# It's does not exists in python but still it is important for interviews. Questions like: How do you emulate the do-while loop in python?

# You can do this after learing break and continue statement in python ( next chapter)
