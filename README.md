### Python_Basics
***
This is the code that I have wrote during my python learning journey. I have also make note to get better understand of mine.

**Update [05-08-2023 10:48 PM] :**
I am busy in study now, like in recent tests I did really bad in Maths and Chemistry, like I failed those tests. But so far I have compeleted basics of python so I changed the name of repo and now I will do the python advance in another repo, but there is a condition:
```python
if half_yearly_exams == pass or "good marks" in range(70, 100):
    print("Back to Python")
else:
    print("I'll continue with study")
```
So, yeah! Let's see what happens.
But I'll do some practice problems in python to stay in touch.
And also for the sake of school.
